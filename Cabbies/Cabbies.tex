\title{Cabbies transport medical staff free of charge in Beijing}

\maketitle

With many citizens staying in, taxis and ride-hailing services have witnessed a business dwindle in many Chinese cities. But some drivers are using this as an opportunity to help the nationwide fight against the epidemic. They are voluntarily driving medical staff from their homes to the hospital treating COVID-19 patients.

For Beijing car-hailing driver Liu Wei, his routine of late includes putting on protective gear before setting off for work.

For almost three weeks now, he and his colleagues on Didi, a ride-hailing service company, have seen helping medical workers at a time when only a few taxi drivers are working. They get support from the company and work on day or night shift for at least 10 hours.

Liu said the recently, he leaves home at about 7 am and gets back home after 6 pm. 

``Now, we're going to You'an and Ditan, the two designated hospitals in Beijing. The staff there has been working really hard. Some have to work consecutively for two to three days. They are exhausted when they leave work,'' Liu said.
